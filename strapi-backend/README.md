# Strapi Backend for KITE Studios

This is the Strapi CMS backend for the KITE Studios website.

## Database Configuration

This project is configured to use:
- **SQLite** for local development
- **PostgreSQL** for production deployment on Railway

This dual configuration makes local development easier while ensuring the production environment is robust and scalable.

### Local Development (SQLite)

SQLite is a file-based database that doesn't require any additional setup. The database file is stored at `.tmp/data.db` in the Strapi backend directory.

### Production (PostgreSQL)

For production, the application will use PostgreSQL provided by Railway. The configuration for this is in the `.env.production` file, which uses environment variables that will be automatically provided by Railway.

## Local Development

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run develop
   ```

3. Access the admin panel at http://localhost:1337/admin

## Deployment on Railway

### Prerequisites

1. Create a Railway account at https://railway.app/
2. Install the Railway CLI:
   ```
   npm install -g @railway/cli
   ```
3. Login to Railway:
   ```
   railway login
   ```

### Steps to Deploy

1. Create a new project on Railway
2. Add a PostgreSQL database to your project
3. Link your local project to Railway:
   ```
   railway link
   ```
4. Deploy your project:
   ```
   railway up
   ```

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables will be automatically provided by Railway for the PostgreSQL database:

- `DATABASE_URL`
- `DATABASE_HOST`
- `DATABASE_PORT`
- `DATABASE_NAME`
- `DATABASE_USERNAME`
- `DATABASE_PASSWORD`

You'll need to set these additional environment variables in the Railway dashboard:

- `APP_KEYS` - Comma-separated random strings
- `API_TOKEN_SALT` - Random string
- `ADMIN_JWT_SECRET` - Random string
- `TRANSFER_TOKEN_SALT` - Random string
- `JWT_SECRET` - Random string

You can generate random strings using:
```
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(16).toString('base64'))"
```

## API Documentation

Once deployed, you can access the API documentation at:
- https://your-railway-url.railway.app/documentation/v1.0.0

## Admin Panel

The admin panel will be available at:
- https://your-railway-url.railway.app/admin
